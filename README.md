# Shopping Website Project

Welcome to the Shopping Website Project! This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built with React and Vite.js. It fetches data from an API and uses Redux ToolKit for state management.
The cart feature allows users to add items to their cart and view them on the cart route.

## Features
- Fetch products from an API
- Display product list
- Add products to cart
- Remove products to cart
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used
- **React:** A javascript library for building user interface
- **Vite.js:** A build tool that provides a faster and learner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit gives a more streamlined and efficient way to manage the state of your application by abstracting away some of the more complex and repetitive aspects of Redux, such as creating reducers and actions.
